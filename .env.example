# EXCHANGE RATE API (Server-side only - DO NOT put in .env.local)
# ============================================
# For LOCAL DEVELOPMENT ONLY:
# The Exchange Rate API key should be added to Vercel environment variables
# for production. For local dev, you can add it here temporarily:
# EXCHANGERATESAPI_KEY=your_api_key_here
#
# Get your API key from: https://exchangeratesapi.io/
# On Vercel deployment, add as environment variable (not in this file)

# ============================================
# NOTES:
# ============================================
# - Variables prefixed with VITE_ are exposed to the client (browser)
# - Only use VITE_ prefix for non-sensitive data (like Supabase public keys)
# - Supabase ANON_KEY is safe to expose (protected by RLS policies)
# - Exchange Rate API key is NOT prefixed with VITE_ (server-side only)
# - Never commit .env.local to git (it's in .gitignore)
